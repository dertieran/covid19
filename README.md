### Database Setup

We use Firebase's [Firestore (docs link)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store game data. You will have to create a freemium account to run the game locally.

All of our firestore related code is in `src/firebase/`. In this folder we have 4 files:

    firebase
    ├── admin-credentials.json
    ├── app.js
    ├── credentials.js
    └── db.js

Inside of `credentials.js` you will see that we are exporting a `config` object with a bunch of environment variables set by Vue. You will need to create a file called `.env.local` and copy the values from `.env.template` into that file.

Your file will look like this:

    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=vue-app-firebase-api-key
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=vue-app-firebase-auth-domain
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=vue-app-firebase-database-url
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=vue-app-firebase-project-id
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=vue-app-firebase-storage-bucket
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=vue-app-firebase-messaging-sender-id
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=vue-app-firebase-app-id
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=vue-app-firebase-measurement-id (this won't be there if you unselected analytics)

Now you will need to go get the correct values for these variables. Navigate to the firebase website, login, and click "Go to Console". You will need to add a new project if you dont have one for this game already.

Click the project and go to project settings. It will be under the pop out menu when you click the cog on the left sidebar.

Under the General tab, scroll down and you will see a code block with section titled "your apps". You need to create a web app (the one with `</>` symbol). You can name it whatever you want. Copy the `firebaseConfig` object. These are the values you need in your `.env.local`.

Now you will need to create your database. Make it a test database so you dont have to worry about permissions.

Now when you click make a descision in the game, it will be stored in your database.

You can take a look at the methods we use to interact with the database in `src/firebase/db.js`.
